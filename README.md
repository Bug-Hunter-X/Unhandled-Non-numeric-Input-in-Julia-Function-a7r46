This repository contains a simple Julia function that demonstrates an example of an uncommon error: failure to handle non-numeric inputs.  The `bug.jl` file shows the initial function with the error, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version. The bug is that the function does not perform type checking before attempting arithmetic operations, which leads to errors when non-numeric data is passed as input.
